# AI-Health-Chatbot


## 🧠 Project Overview

**AI Health Chartbot** is an intelligent system that transforms natural language instructions into visual data representations. By combining **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **data visualization libraries**, the bot understands user queries and automatically generates the appropriate chart — such as bar graphs, pie charts, line plots, and more.

This project enables users to interact with data in a human-friendly way, making chart creation accessible to non-programmers through conversational input.
